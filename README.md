# Description

The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science at Berkeley, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.

CS61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. CS61A primarily uses the Python 3 programming language.
